# Procedural Equirectangular Textures

## Licence
	
You can use this site to generate online textures. You are allowed:

* **to freely use the textures** in anything: web sites, publications, presentations, printed materials, company logos, billboards, games, movies, adverticements;

* **to modify, adapt and build** on the textures in any imaginable way;

* **to release your work** with the textures under any licence of your choice.


However, we hope that:

* the textures are not used in any immoral, illegal, misleading or diceptive context;
* you understand that anyone could recreate the exact same textures, that you have already created with pasion and love;
* you find the textures useful.
